                        <p class="grounded">GROUNDED IN SCIENCE AND SUPPORTING INCREMENTAL CHANGE FOR THE BETTER</p>
                        <p class="programs">All Oldways programs are grounded in the science of nutrition and good health, a principle that is not aﬀected by our funding sources. Here’s how we operate, in relation to our three largest funding sources:</p>
                        <p class="grounded">REGIONAL AND NATIONAL TRADE PROMOTION GROUPS</p>
                        <p class="programs">When we accept funding from organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce in Puglia, our goal is to educate people about traditional foods around the world, and to help ensure the survival of artisanal producers of these foods. We promote healthy traditional foods from places around the world, and never promote one food or region over another.</p>
                        <p class="grounded">PRIVATE AND PUBLIC COMPANIES</p>
                        <p class="programs">Corporate funding comes largely from memberships and sponsorships that support our consumer education programs (the<span class="orange"> Whole Grains Council,</span> the <span class="orange">Mediterranean Foods Alliance</span>, and <span class="orange">Oldways Vegetarian Network</span>) and that support our outreach to dietitians and health professionals through the <span class="orange">Oldways Nutrition Exchange</span> and the <span class="orange">Supermarket Dietitian Symposium</span>. We’re occasionally asked: How we can reconcile accepting ﬁnancial support from well-known food companies who manufacture, market, and/or sell less-than-healthy foods or drinks, with our core mission of helping Americans to eat healthier? We believe that we can make more changes by engaging in constructive dialog with food and drink companies, and by showing them how they can make a reasonable proﬁt, and provide jobs, while making better products than they did before.</p>
                        <p class="programs">Change is almost always incremental, so some of the companies we work with may still make products that we neither endorse nor eat or drink ourselves. Yet we continue to be dedicated to pushing them as far as we can in the right direction—not by scolding but by providing positive incentives and practical programs. The good news is we are ﬁnding that more and more food companies are recognizing that many Americans want to eat healthier, and that our eﬀorts are leading companies to supplement (or in some cases, reformulate) their product lines with healthier options. Oldways is very pleased to be a part of this evolving process.</p>
                        <p class="grounded">FOUNDATIONS</p>
                        <p class="programs">In the past, we recieved foundation support comes from The Walmart Foundation for the<span class="orange"> African Heritage and Health Program.</span></p>
