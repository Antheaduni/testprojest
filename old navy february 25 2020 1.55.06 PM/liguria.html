      <p>Oldways, James Beard award-winning Chef Barbara Lynch, and Ronni Baer, Senior Curator of European Paintings, traveled to Liguria in the Italian Riviera in 2017. A crescent along the Mediterranean Sea, Liguria is a region dominated by both water and the land. It is the home of pesto, the birthplace of Christopher Columbus, and is known for its aromatic herbs and terraced mountainsides. Food writer Fred Plotkin maintains it is “as close to paradise as one can ﬁnd on this earth.”</p>

      <p class="bases">Our trip was based at both ends of Liguria—in Rapallo and San Remo—and we ventured into the mountain valleys and alongside the sea to eat, to experience and to learn about the places and the ingredients that make Liguria such a special destination.  We also slipped into France to spend a day in Menton—the namesake of one of Barbara Lynch’s restaurants.</p>
